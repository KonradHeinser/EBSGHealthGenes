Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod adds 37 new genes. 8 of them for impacting biosculpting speed by 33%, 66%, 150%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, and 400%. The remaining 29 genes are part of the EBSG - Body Parts section, and remove or damage various parts on xenotypes with that gene. Most of these damages can be reversed by completely replacing the part, but until your colony is developed enough for that I recommend not letting that pawn that's missing a kidney get too sick.

Note: The damage organs genes sometimes doesn't take away exactly half of a part's health due to weird rounding. It should still be very close though, just sometimes half a point to a point of damage off.
Note 2: If you combine enough of the genes you can end up with a pawn that is constantly downed. Non-vital parts (eyes, ears, etc) won't cause these issues, but if you gain 5 or more metabolic efficiency from damaging/removing vital/moving parts the risk of downing increases considerably. For example, met 3 lungs + met 3 legs will usually stop most of a pawn's movements.
